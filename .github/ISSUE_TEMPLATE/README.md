- **Validation**: Required fields ensure complete information
- **Categories**: Dropdown menus reduce typing and standardize responses

### For Copilot Agent Effectiveness
- **Structured Information**: Consistent format makes parsing easier
- **Complete Context**: All necessary details provided upfront
- **Clear Acceptance Criteria**: Specific, measurable outcomes defined
- **Priority Indicators**: Urgency and impact clearly specified
- **Action-Oriented**: Templates focus on what needs to be done

### Quality Assurance
- **Required Fields**: Critical information cannot be omitted
- **Checklists**: Pre-submission validation prevents incomplete requests
- **Examples**: Concrete examples guide proper completion
- **Categorization**: Proper labeling for issue tracking and assignment

## Usage Guidelines

### For Teachers
1. **Choose the Right Template**: Select the template that best matches your need
2. **Be Specific**: Provide detailed information rather than general descriptions
3. **Include Context**: Explain why the change is needed and who it affects
4. **Check Examples**: Use the placeholder text as guidance for your responses
5. **Complete Checklists**: Ensure all validation items are checked before submitting

### For System Administrators
- Templates automatically assign issues to `@copilot` for processing
- Labels are pre-configured for proper categorization and filtering
- Contact links in `config.yml` can be updated with actual school contact information
- Templates can be customized by modifying the `.yml` files in this directory

## Configuration

The `config.yml` file controls the issue template selection interface:
- **Blank Issues Disabled**: Forces use of templates for better structure

- **Documentation Links**: Directs users to additional resources
